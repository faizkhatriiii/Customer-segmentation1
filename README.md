# Customer Segmentation Dataset

## Unsupervised Learning Online Retail Customer Segmentation

## Description:
A company that sells some of the product, and you want to know how well does the selling performance of the product. You have the data that can we analyze, but what kind of analysis that we can do? Well, we can segment customers based on their buying behavior on the market.
Keep in mind that the data is really huge, and we can not analyze it using our bare eyes. We will use machine learning algorithms and the power of computing for it.

This project will show you how to cluster customers on segments based on their behavior using the K-Means algorithm in Python.
I hope that this projec# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering

## 1. Problem Statement

### Business Challenge
In today's competitive retail environment, understanding customer behavior is crucial for business success. The company faced several key challenges:

- **Large Dataset Complexity**: With thousands of transactions and customers, manual analysis was impossible
- **Customer Diversity**: Different customers exhibit varying purchasing patterns that need to be identified
- **Resource Allocation**: Limited marketing budget required targeted customer engagement strategies
- **Personalization Gap**: One-size-fits-all marketing approach was yielding suboptimal results

### Objective
Develop an unsupervised machine learning solution to automatically segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling data-driven marketing strategies and improved customer relationship management.

### Dataset Overview
- **Source**: Online Retail dataset containing transactional data
- **Size**: Large-scale dataset with multiple customer transactions
- **Key Features**: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

## 2. Solution Approach

### Methodology: RFM Analysis with K-Means Clustering

#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
```python
# Data cleaning and preparation
data = data.dropna(subset=["CustomerID"])  # Remove missing customer IDs
data = data[data["Quantity"] > 0]          # Remove negative quantities
data["TotalPrice"] = data["Quantity"] * data["UnitPrice"]  # Calculate total spent
```

#### Step 2: RFM Feature Engineering
**RFM Analysis** - A proven marketing technique that examines:
- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency (F)**: How often a customer makes purchases
- **Monetary (M)**: How much money a customer spends

```python
# RFM calculation
rfm = data.groupby("CustomerID").agg({
    "InvoiceNo": "count",      # Frequency
    "TotalPrice": "sum"        # Monetary
})

# Recency calculation
latest_date = data["InvoiceDate"].max() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
recency["Recency"] = (latest_date - recency["InvoiceDate"]).dt.days
```

#### Step 3: Optimal Cluster Selection
Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=3) by analyzing the inertia values across different k values.

#### Step 4: K-Means Clustering Implementation
```python
# Standardization and clustering
scaler = StandardScaler()
rfm_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(rfm[["Recency", "Frequency", "Monetary"]])

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
rfm["Cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(rfm_scaled)
```

#### Step 5: Customer Segment Interpretation
The algorithm identified three distinct customer segments:
- **Cluster 0: Loyal Customers** - Regular purchasers with consistent buying patterns
- **Cluster 1: Occasional Customers** - Infrequent buyers with moderate spending
- **Cluster 2: Big Spenders** - High-value customers with significant monetary contributions
